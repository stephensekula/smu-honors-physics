The most basic program you can write will begin with a \"data member\" (e.g. a number, such as \"1\") and execute its arithmetic \"operators\" (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on another data member in order to combine them under that operation. See below for examples. Feel free to change examples! Play around. To learn, we must play!"

    "Python cares about decimal points. If the first number in an operation is without a decimal place, Python treats it as a pure integer and all subsequent operations are done using integer arithmetic (no decimal places, and rounding is applied!). If the first number contains a decimal place, the operations are treated as \"floating point operations\" - decimal number arithmetic, with remainders represented as decimal fractions. See examples below."
